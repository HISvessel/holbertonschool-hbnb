Inside this repository, files and documents are present which display the contents of our very first large project: the Holberton Bed and Breakfast. So far, in this project we learn about working with UML, presetting APIs. The prupose of these UMLs is understanding the relation between all objects created and updated, all methods to be used and the connection of every piece for a seamless user experience. So far, our first part of these diagrams are related to the class logic and the business logic of the objects, which show how classes are made, what to keep in mind for the user experience, how they connect with each other and what to expect about the application's functionality. This ReadMe will see further improvements and more additions as the project takes a moe concrete shape. Stay sharp.
